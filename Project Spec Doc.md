- Project Goal and Scope:
  - Our team is doing analysis on Amazon reviews
    -	We would like to determine what the “hot” words are for each product category. 
    - We will first filter by product category
- From there, we can do word count analysis to see what the most common words are for each product category. 
- - - After that, we can use sentiment analysis in R (or Python) to determine what are the most “positive sentiment” products vs. the most “negative sentiment” products. 
- - - In addition, we can rank products by which seem to have the most positive or popular reviews
- - - We then can input in Tableau to visually see differences between different product categories
- - - We will also compare the reviews/review ratings  of the product for the first 90 day of the product launch and after the 90 days of the product launch. ( comparison about different categories, clothings vs electronic items)  
- - - We will also try to predict the rating of the product with the customer’s review of the product. 
- Performance Requirements:
- - Our dataset is huge, almost 400 MB, so we will need several nodes to enhance performance and speed of processing
